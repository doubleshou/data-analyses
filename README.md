# Personal data analysis projects

This general repository contains a range of personal data analysis projects. They include:
* [heart-disease-prediction](https://github.com/kamilpytlak/data-analyses/tree/main/heart-disease-prediction) - SAS to CSV format conversion, feature selection, and data cleaning from a telephone survey data of approximately 400k U.S. residents conducted in 2020. The project also includes building two machine learning models: logistic regression and random forest. The logistic regression model was used to build a web-based predictive application: https://github.com/kamilpytlak/heart-condition-checker. The cleaned dataset was published on my Kaggle profile and is publicly available to download and play: https://www.kaggle.com/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease;
